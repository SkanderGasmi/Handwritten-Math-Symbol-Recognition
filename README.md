# Handwritten-Math-Symbol-Recognition
A machine learning project that focuses on recognizing handwritten mathematical symbols using various classification algorithms like K-Means, Logistic Regression, and SVM. This repository includes a step-by-step implementation, evaluation, and comparison of the methods using the HASYv2 dataset, a small dataset of hand-drawn mathematical symbols.
